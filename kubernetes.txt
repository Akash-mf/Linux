lsb_release -a command is not working in redHat LinuxThe lsb_release -a command is used to display information about the Linux distribution on systems that follow the Linux Standard Base (LSB) specifications. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives like CentOS do not strictly follow the LSB specifications, which is why the lsb_release command may not work as expected on these distributions.
Instead, you can use the following commands to get similar information on RHEL and CentOS systems:

To display the distribution name and version:

Copy codecat /etc/redhat-release
This will print the distribution name and version, for example:
Copy codeRed Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.6 (Ootpa)

To display additional system information:

Copy codehostnamectl
This will display various system details, including the Operating System name, version, kernel version, and more.
Alternatively, you can use the rpm command to query installed packages:
Copy coderpm -q redhat-release
This will show the installed redhat-release package version, which indicates the RHEL/CentOS version.
So, while lsb_release may not work as expected on RHEL/CentOS, there are other native tools available to gather similar distribution and system information.

To display the RHEL version:

Copy codecat /etc/redhat-release
This will print the RHEL version, for example:
Copy codeRed Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.0 (Plow)

To display detailed system information:

Copy codehostnamectl
This will show details like Operating System, Kernel, Architecture, etc.

To query the installed redhat-release package version:

Copy coderpm -q redhat-release
This will output the version of the redhat-release package, which corresponds to the RHEL version.
Additionally, RHEL 9 has introduced a new tool called redhat-release-info that can provide more detailed information about the RHEL distribution:
Copy coderedhat-release-info
This command will display the RHEL version, codename, CPU architecture, and various other details in a structured format.
So in summary, for RHEL 9 you can use cat /etc/redhat-release, hostnamectl, rpm -q redhat-release, and the new redhat-release-info command to get distribution and system information, instead of the lsb_release command which is not officially supported on RHEL.

Enable the Amazon Web Services RPM package repository

Run the following command to import the AWS RPM package signing key:
Copy codesudo rpm --import https://download.mono-project.com/repo/xamarin.gpg
Then, create a new file named /etc/yum.repos.d/aws.repo with the following contents:
Copy code[aws]
name=AWS RPMs
baseurl=https://rpm.amazonaws.com/latest/amzn2-core-for-rhel-9/
enabled=1

Install the AWS CLI

With the AWS repository enabled, you can now install the AWS CLI package using the dnf package manager:
Copy codesudo dnf install aws-cli
This will install the latest version of the AWS CLI along with its dependencies.

Verify the Installation

After the installation is complete, you can verify the AWS CLI version:
Copy codeaws --version
This should display the version of the AWS CLI that you have installed.

Configure the AWS CLI (Optional)

If you want to use the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials, you can configure it by running:
Copy codeaws configure
This command will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.
Once you've completed these steps, you'll be able to use the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services from your RHEL 9 system.
Note: Make sure you have an active internet connection during the installation process, as the packages will be downloaded from the AWS repository.

I have facing this issues Command 'curl' not found , but can be installed with: snap install curl #version 8.1.2 or apt install curl #version 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 see 'snap info curl' for additional versions . gzip : stdin : unexpected end of file tar: child returned status 1 tar :L error is not recoverable: existing nowClaude does not have internet access and cannot get up to date info from web links.The issue you're facing is that the curl command is not installed on your RHEL 9 system, which is required to download the eksctl binary from the provided URL.
To install curl on RHEL 9, you can use the dnf package manager:
Copy codesudo dnf install curl
After installing curl, you should be able to run the command to download and extract the eksctl binary:
Copy codecurl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
This command will download the latest eksctl binary for your system architecture and extract it to the /tmp directory.
If you still face issues with the tar command, you can try using the following alternative command:
Copy codecurl -sL "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar -xzv -C /tmp
After the binary is extracted, you can move it to a directory included in your system's PATH environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin:
Copy codesudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
Finally, you can verify the installation by checking the eksctl version:
Copy codeeksctl version
