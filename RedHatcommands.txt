Red hat enterprise Linux commands for Patch and update operating system and applications

Here are some common Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) commands for patching and updating the operating system and applications:

System Update:
yum update: Update all installed packages to their latest versions.
yum update package_name: Update a specific package to its latest version.
yum upgrade: Upgrade all packages to the latest compatible versions.

Package Installation:
yum install package_name: Install a new package.
yum groupinstall group_name: Install a group of related packages.

Package Removal:
yum remove package_name: Remove an installed package.
yum groupremove group_name: Remove a group of related packages.

Package Information:
yum info package_name: Display information about a package.
yum list installed: List all installed packages.
yum list available: List all available packages in the configured repositories.

Repository Management:
yum repolist: List all enabled and disabled repositories.
yum-config-manager --enable repo_name: Enable a specific repository.
yum-config-manager --disable repo_name: Disable a specific repository.

System Update with DNF (Dandified YUM):
dnf update: Update all installed packages to their latest versions.
dnf upgrade: Upgrade all packages to the latest compatible versions.

Kernel Updates:
yum update kernel: Update the kernel to the latest version.
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg: Update the GRUB configuration after a kernel update.

Applying Patches and Errata:
yum update --security: Update only security-related packages.
yum update --advisory=advisory_id: Update packages related to a specific advisory.

Cleanup and Maintenance:
yum clean all: Clean up cached package data and metadata.
package-cleanup --oldkernels --count=2: Keep only the two most recent kernel versions.

Monitoring Updates:
yum check-update: Check for available package updates.
yum updateinfo: Display information about available updates, including security advisories and bug fixes.
Note that in RHEL 8 and later versions, the dnf package manager is introduced as the successor to yum. However, yum is still supported for backward compatibility. It's recommended to use dnf for newer RHEL versions.

Additionally, you can use graphical package managers like gnome-software or yumex for a more user-friendly experience in managing updates and packages.

Remember to always exercise caution when updating packages, as it may potentially impact system stability or application functionality. It's advisable to review the update details, perform proper testing, and create system backups before applying critical updates.

Monitor system performance

Here are some common Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) commands and tools for monitoring system performance:

Top:
top: Display real-time information about running processes, CPU and memory usage.

htop:
htop: An interactive process viewer with improved visuals and features compared to top.

System Monitor:
gnome-system-monitor: A graphical system monitoring tool for GNOME desktop environments.

CPU:
mpstat: Report processors-related data.
iostat: Monitor CPU load, disk I/O statistics, and more.

Memory:
free: Display the amount of free and used memory.

These commands and tools can provide valuable insights into various system performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network traffic, and more. However, it's essential to interpret the output correctly and establish appropriate baselines and thresholds for your specific system and workloads.

Additionally, RHEL offers advanced monitoring solutions like Red Hat Insights and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, which provide comprehensive monitoring, analytics, and automation capabilities for large-scale deployments.
