Sure, here are some related Linux commands similar to netstat:

ss: The ss command is used to dump socket statistics. It can display more TCP and state information than other tools. It is considered a replacement for netstat.

Example: ss -tuln to display all TCP and UDP sockets.
ip route: The ip route command is used to manipulate routing tables. It can be used to display, add, delete, or modify routes.

Example: ip route show to display routing table.
ip -s link: The ip -s link command is used to display network interface statistics.

Example: ip -s link show to display detailed statistics for all interfaces.
ip maddr: The ip maddr command is used to display and manipulate multicast group information.

Example: ip maddr show to display multicast group memberships.
ipchains: The ipchains command is used to set up and configure packet filtering rules in the Linux kernel's networking stack.

Example: ipchains -L to list the current set of rules.
These commands offer various functionalities related to networking and can be used to gather information and configure networking aspects of the Linux system.

Here are some useful Linux commands for troubleshooting:

dmesg: Shows kernel log messages, which can help diagnose issues related to hardware, driver issues, or system startup.
lsof: Lists open files and the processes that have opened them. Useful for finding processes that are locking files or resources.
strace: Traces system calls and signals of a running process, which can help debug program behavior.
tcpdump: Captures network traffic for analysis, helpful for diagnosing network-related issues.
lsmod: Lists loaded kernel modules, which can help identify if a particular module is loaded or not.
top or htop: Displays real-time information about running processes, CPU and memory usage, which can help identify resource hogs.
ps aux: Lists all running processes with details like CPU and memory usage.
netstat: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
iotop: Monitors disk I/O usage, useful for diagnosing disk-related performance issues.
journalctl: Displays system logs from the systemd journal, helpful for troubleshooting system and service issues.
free: Shows the amount of free and used memory in the system.
df: Reports file system disk space usage.
du: Estimates file space usage, useful for finding large files or directories.
tail or head: Displays the last or first few lines of a file, often used to monitor log files.
lspci and lsusb: Lists PCI and USB devices, respectively, which can help identify hardware components.
uname -a: Prints system information, including the kernel version.
These commands, combined with their various options and filters, can be powerful tools for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues on Linux systems.
